0. Store sequences at indices with (sequence, QName) so that they can be uniquely identified.
1. set overlap_target to under_index.
2. get all sequences which could overlap under_index, and which have not already been selected. (how get these, by using samtools view again? or store in memory? only need a UNIQUE identifier and the sequence length)
3. choose sequences a. randomly b. minimize overflow (the sequence closest to under_index) this may result in a bias towards reads beginning at a given index.  c. minimize overflow probabilistically. d. the sequence which has the longest length after under_index. This will deal with the situation where you picked a short sequence which didn't cover a coming index, before you knew you wouldn't need it.
